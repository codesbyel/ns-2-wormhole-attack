# ns-2-wormhole-attack
A wormhole attack simulation using NS-2 with Ubuntu 20.04

Overview: 
Wormhole attack, an attacker records packets (or bits) at one location in the network, tunnels them to another location, and re-transmits them there into the network. 
Wormhole attacker creates a tunnel in order to record the ongoing communication and traffic at one network position and channels them to another position in the network.


Tools used in this project are: 
1. VMWare Workstation 16 Player
2. NS-2.35
3. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
